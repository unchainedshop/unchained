# Unchained Engine v4.0.0 ("Tell")

This release brings you FerretDB and cloud-hosted MongoDB support (AWS / Azure) via the DocumentDB SDK. You can now run Unchained against a PostgreSQL database: https://ferretdb.com. Be warned, the performance penalty is quite significant currently. Additionally, you can't use `queryString` arguments in queries like `searchProducts` or `countries` at this time.

We also added experimental MCP support 🤖, so any AI app can now manage products in Unchained. We've also added an AI chat feature to the Admin UI.
Known limitations:
- Only users with admin role can access the MCP server.
- If you want to use the MCP server in clients like Claude Code, Visual Studio, etc., you need to either set an Access Token or enable OAuth 2.1. Check out our OIDC example to see how this can be achieved.
- We will bring more tools to the table with upcoming minor releases, currently only basic product management is enabled

Then, we started to make it easier for you to hide products and assortments from search by exposing functional factory methods for creating the appropriate filter plugins:

```ts
import { registerProductDiscoverabilityFilter } from '@unchainedshop/core';
registerProductDiscoverabilityFilter({ hiddenTagValue: 'hidden' });
```


**Attention: If you upgrade to this version from <3, first upgrade to the latest v3 to not miss any migrations.**

## Major
- Added `Mutation.updateCartPaymentInvoice`, `Mutation.updateCartPaymentGeneric`, `Mutation.updateCartDeliveryPickUp`, `Mutation.updateCartDeliveryShipping`. Those mutations do not only change the provider's configuration but also set the provider as current provider on the cart/orderId provided. As this new flow is superior to the old one involving calling multiple mutations and holding a deliveryId/paymentId in memory for clients, we deprecated the following mutations: `Mutation.updateOrderDeliveryShipping`, `Mutation.updateOrderDeliveryPickUp`, `Mutation.updateOrderPaymentInvoice`, `Mutation.updateOrderPaymentGeneric`, `Mutation.setOrderPaymentProvider`, `Mutation.setOrderDeliveryProvider`
- Removed `CARD` type for payments. We never used it and it doesn't make sense to provide card data in plaintext. Removing `Mutation.updateOrderPaymentCard`.
- Boolean filter types do not support an undefined or null state of values and whenever the key is set in a filter query and it's of type SWITCH (for ex. `[{ key: "meta.feeds.googleAds" }]` it will only show products that have a value of true. You can still do a "NOT" filtering by explicitly providing a value of false or 0: `[{ key: "meta.feeds.googleAds", value: "false" }]`
- `Query.eventsCount` and `Query.events` now accept a DateFilterInput (start/end range) for the created date.
- The Locale Context has been refactored and all API's that had the old chaotic naming: What was once countryContext, currencyContext or localeContext is now countryCode, currencyCode, locale throughout the system: The type of locale fields in the API are now validated at the GraphQL Server level. This effects a lot of plugins too, please check migration-v4.md.
- Platform: Use `transformRetry` instead of `retryInput` to adjust re-scheduling behavior in startPlatform `workQueueOptions`.
- Platform: New `workQueueOptions` parameter `enabledQueueManagers` can be adjusted to customize the work queue managing plugins (#634).

## Minor
- Add Node.js v24 support
- Bundle Products now support pricing on their own, resulting in an actually usable bundle implementation 😳 By default, the catalog pricing plugin fallbacks to 
- Add various loaders to optimize db requests and improve the overall performance of the system
- DocumentDB (FerretDB, Azure, AWS) compatibility mode: Use `UNCHAINED_DOCUMENTDB_COMPAT_MODE` to disable $text indexes and $search queries.
- Improve docs
- Add filters to `Query.orders` to filter by payment and delivery providers
- Allow to call `Query.deliveryInterfaces` without a type
- Add support for SMS providers BudgetSMS and Bulkgate next to Twilio on our privacy-focused mission to always support European alternatives.
- Add `productTags` & `assortmentTags` field in `shopInfo.adminUiConfig` that will return existing tags used for products and assortments and can also be customized to include default tags using `UNCHAINED_DEFAULT_PRODUCT_TAGS` and/or `UNCHAINED_DEFAULT_ASSORTMENT_TAGS`.
- Add option to configure `adminUiConfig.customProperties` through `UNCHAINED_ADMIN_UI_CUSTOM_PROPERTIES` env in addition to platform configuration option that accepts a json file
- Add option to configure `adminUiConfig.singleSignOnURL` through `UNCHAINED_SINGLE_SIGN_ON_URL` env in addition to platform configuration option

## Patch
- Update to ESlint 9
- Use @scure packages to reduce dependency hell around cryptography
- Remove the 'twilio' dependency (> 5mb) with a single native fetch call to the Twilio API 🤪
- Improve style of typescript definitions
- Fix Types not published to docs.unchained.shop
- Fix Fastify handler to upload temp files
- Fix localeContext not returning the correct region #649

# Unchained Engine v3.0 ("Odi")

We are thrilled to announce Unchained Engine v3.0, 5 years after the first version. We started with an overloaded framework approach using Meteor and gradually removed dependency by dependency, getting closer to the metal and in-line with today's standards. Unchained Engine...
- ...is 100% ESM and self-hosted
- ...loves WebCrypto, Fetch API, WebPush, URL, WebAuthn, oAuth
- ...runs on Bun, Node.js and Serverless frameworks.
- ...doesn't use ORM systems; can leverage the db driver to it's fullest potential 😉
- ...hates federated graphs; is fast 😉
- ...loves developers and hates "customizing"; is super extensible and un-oppinionated about your project 🥸

Besides the ideology about the technical stuff, it basically provides all the GraphQL API's you need to build a modern Web-Shop, Ticketing System.

## Ticketing
I don't know if you have heard it but there is a new package "ticketing". It allows self-hosted ticketing with Apple Wallet and PDF Printing...

## Removing the Auth Fat
We experienced feature creep in the authentication part of Unchained and suddenly woke up to homemade implementations of Two-Factor Auth via TOTP, WebAuthn, oAuth, Impersonator features etc. Many solutions like Zitadel, Keycloak, Auth0 etc. solve that just perfect and keep up with the ever increasing complexity of auth mechanisms. At the same time, core-accountsjs depends on a package called accountsjs which is unmaintained and uses a conflicting old mongodb driver.

That's why we have decided to remove various auth features that are better solved through Identity Management systems and migrate to passport.js which is also ESM now. That opens the door to complex login methods like OpenID Connect through the community of passport.js.

We will keep supporting the following auth-strategies out of the box that we consider widely known web standards:
- E-Mail/Username & Password
- WebAuthn (Passkeys)
- Access Tokens

## Service Layer Refactoring
When we first started with the module approach, cross-module functions like the checkout were using functions of each other, creating bi-directional dependencies that were hard to manage. With the newest release, we have moved out all bi-directional function calls into the `core` umbrella package.

We got rid of about 1'000 lines of code doing that and dramatically reduced complexity across the platform. `context.services` now houses all those methods and the core modules are cleanly separated mainly doing DB abstraction work.

## Bye bye Apollo Server
We switched over from Apollo Server to GraphQL Yoga. It's just better in all ways possible. Okay, thanks, bye. Checkout the kitchensink or example projects to see how you can switch over or consult the [Migration Guide](./migration-v3.md).

## Better Typescript Support
Removed `@unchainedshop/types`. All types needed are now coming directly from the corresponding packages which leads to clearer intents and types beeing more strict and in sync with the actual code. This has a massive impact on custom backend code. Please check the [Migration Guide](./migration-v3.md) for further instructions besides that.

## Massive Performance Improvements & Experimental Fastify Support
Queries involving catalog and products are now approximately **3 times faster** due to improved usage of caching, dataloader techniques and less db roundtrips in general.

Checkouts are about **2 times faster**, too.

With the new (still experimental) Fastify and Bun support, we further increased baseline query response times everywhere (checkout the minimal example).

Along the way we thought it would be nice to remove about 100 NPM module dependencies, so we did that, too. Oh my god yes.

## BREAKING API CHANGES
Behavioral Change: Cart total are now null if there is no item in the cart and needs to be defaulted to an amount of 0 by the frontend. The reason for this change is that a free position could still have delivery or payment fees based on the article. So in order to communicate that to the frontend, we can't price an order when we don't know what is beeing ordered. As orders without a price can't be checked out it makes that clear to the client, too.

- `Price._id` **removed** (this only caused problems with caching behavior and added weight to the code)
- `Stock._id` **removed** (this only caused problems with caching behavior and added weight to the code)
- `Dispatch._id` **removed** (this only caused problems with caching behavior and added weight to the code)

## Major
- Drop support for Node.js <22.x
- Drop Amazon Document DB compatibility mode because it's not needed anymore with 5.0
- `from` & `to` to `dateRange` of type `DateFilterInput` for consistency.
- Auth: Removed `core-accounts`, migrated some settings partially to user settings (removed sendVerificationEmailAfterSignup, introduced new validation functions)
- Auth: Remove logoutAllSessions and remove support for loging out a specific session
- Auth: Introduce default password rules (min. 8 chars)

- Auth: Drop oAuth support (if you need special authentication strategies, use a passport or fastify plugin)
- Core: 99% of all Director's and Adapters have a new home in `@unchainedshop/core`, so for ex. `import { IPaymentAdapter } from '@unchainedshop/core-payment';` becomes `import { IPaymentAdapter } from '@unchainedshop/core';`
- Core: The order module function `initProviders` has been moved to order services renamed as `initCartProviders`
- Core: The order module function `updateCalculation` has been moved to order services
- Core: The order module function `invalidateProviders` has been removed, the caller now uses the new `findCartsToInvalidate` to get the list of carts and then calls the new updateCalculation service
- Core: We have moved so many module functions to services that we stop here because of lazyness... 😁 Typescript can help you there haha.
- API: Add built-in Fastify support
- API: Add built-in Yoga support (we are going to deprecate Apollo Server starting from 4.x)
- API: `LoginMethodResponse` has a new breaking GraphQL type
- Platform: Removed sugar connectPlatformToExpress4 to save dependencies when running in no-express env, use `import { connect } from '@unchainedshop/api/express/index.js'` now.


## Minor
- Improved cookie handling
- API: Extend `Mutation.confirmOrder` and `Mutation.rejectOrder` with a comment field. Allows to provide arbitrary data like a rejection reason that you can use in messaging.
- API: Change argument format of `Query.workStatistics`, `Query.eventStatistics` & `Query.orderStatistics` from previous 
- API: Extend `Query.users` to accept additional filter options `emailVerified` & `lastLogin` 
- Plugins: Add AWS Event Bridge Plugin for Serverless Mode
- Update Stripe


# Unchained Engine v2.14

## Minor
- API: Extend `Mutation.confirmOrder` and `Mutation.rejectOrder` with a comment field. Allows to provide arbitrary data like a rejection reason that you can use in messaging.
- API: `Product.simulatedPrice` now accepts an optional configuration so you can also provide arbitrary configs to simulate prices
- API: New Queries have been added to gather basic statistical data: `Query.eventStatistics`, `Query.orderStatistics`, `Query.workStatistics`.
- API: Add `Mutation.invalidateToken` to manually mark a token as invalidated
- API: Add `Query.tokens`, `TokenizedProduct.tokens` and `Order.tokens` to get all tokens or tokens related to entitites based on permission. 
- API: Extend `Token` with new fields: `isInvalidateable`, `accessKey`, `invalidatedDate`, `expiryDate`.
- API: `Query.orders` and `User.orders` now accept a parameter `status` to filter by order status
- `setLoginToken` has been changed slightly and needs to have `res` supplied as first param
- Add new events `TOKEN_OWNERSHIP_CHANGED` and `TOKEN_INVALIDATED`
- The order deliveries module now exports `activePickUpLocation` to easily get the current pick up location
- The locale-context has been refactored completely, allowing unchained to properly cache country and currency detection based on a combination of user/http-headers
- Extend bulk import with a new option `updateShouldUpsertIfIDNotExists` that does what it says it does ^^
- Remove `lru-cache` for texts because that is beeing done by Apollo Cache

# Unchained Engine v2.13

## Minor
- Add `Query.validateVerifyEmailToken` that can be used to verify if a token is valid for use when verifying email
- Add `Query.validateResetPasswordToken` that can be used to verify if a token is valid for use on password reset request
- Re-Scheduling Bahvior of auto-scheduled work has been refined (https://github.com/unchainedshop/unchained/issues/565) and the GraphQL API now contains "Work.autoscheduled" in order for the Admin UI to display auto-scheduled work.
- Add `Query.validateVerifyEmailToken` that can be used to verify if a token is valid for use when verifying email
- Add `Query.validateResetPasswordToken` that can be used to verify if a token is valid for use on password reset request
- Added Payrexx plugin
- Changed the way order events work to fix a longstanding bug with double-messaging due to webhooks getting called in-flight. This affects ORDER_CHECKOUT, ORDER_CONFIRMED, ORDER_REJECTED & ORDER_FULLFILLED: Now the updated order is beeing emitted together with a new property "oldStatus" containing the previous order status. Also, order messaging module functions have been removed from `core-orders` and are now privately setup in `setupTemplates` @ platform.

## Patch
- Allow CORS for upload handling
- Fix avatar upload in PUT mode

# Unchained Engine v2.7

## Minor
- Mutation `signPaymentProviderForCheckout` does not require an orderPaymentId anymore, it will try to sign the currently selected paymentProvider of the cart if left undefined. This will allow doing 1 request (multi mutation) checkouts in certain configurations.
- Improve discount types
- Extend the functionality of the default `product-discount` plugin so it's universally usable for different kind of product discounts

## Patch
- Fix a case with `order-discount` and `order-items-discount` plugins not appropriately applying a rate to payment and delivery fees

# Unchained Engine v2.6

## Minor
- Add `shop.unchained.pricing.order-round` order price rounding plugin
- Remove obsolete internal `addRoles` from users
- Utility functions have been moved `generateDbFilterById`, `buildSortOptions` and `generateDbObjectId` from `@unchainedshop/utils` to `@unchainedshop/mongodb`;
- Protect `upsertLocalizedText` in the core packages products, filters & assortments. Forces the developer to use updateTexts or equivalent functions. This is the first step with the goal to move all localized texts to it's appropriate root documents in order to reduce roundtrips to the db.
- Remove events `PRODUCT_UPDATE_VARIATION_TEXTS`, `PRODUCT_UPDATE_TEXTS`, `FILTER_UPDATE_TEXTS`, `ASSORTMENT_UPDATE_TEXTS` (triggered for every product when text changes)
- Add new events `PRODUCT_UPDATE_VARIATION_TEXT`, `PRODUCT_UPDATE_TEXT`, `FILTER_UPDATE_TEXT`, `ASSORTMENT_UPDATE_TEXT` (triggered for every locale & product when text changes).
- The `_CREATE` events for products, filters and assortments are now triggered AFTER creating the initial text objects so that you can safely use both events to update texts in external systems.
- Add new worker configuration option `blacklistedVariables` that accepts array of variable names that should be removed from a job log data returned.
- Deprecated `APOLLO_ENGINE_KEY` from old apollo versions has been removed
- An undocumented worker internal event queue has been removed and new `events` have been added to support subscribing to `core-worker` events: `WORK_ADDED`, `WORK_ALLOCATED`, `WORK_FINISHED`, `WORK_DELETED`, `WORK_RESCHEDULED`

## Patch
- Fix payment credential signing procedures that depend on a userId
- Fix worker not cleaning regression
- Fix local-search plugin
- Fix WebAuthn plugin to not crash when https://mds.fidoalliance.org is not available for catalog download
- Typescript type improvements
- Remove dead code
- Bulk Importer now uses the files plugin underneath to store large bulk import payload files

# Unchained Engine v2.5

This small release improves impersonation and pricing, allowing for better support of e-commerce platforms that want to show net prices all along until the end.

## Minor
- Allow to configure an "environment" for stripe which allows to drop events coming to the the engine that are intended to land on another engine not causing false negatives in webhooks.
- Add Error Report job that sends failed work items to an E-Mail Address of choice defined by `EMAIL_ERROR_REPORT_RECIPIENT`
- Remove `mjml` templates because of excessive size of mjml dependencies. Here are the old ones: https://github.com/unchainedshop/unchained/tree/3fabb6cbe55682aa2ee69a246758a09db908fe26/packages/platform/src/templates
- Add support for net and gross calculation on order items and order totals: Added useNetPrice parameter to `OrderItem.total`, `OrderItem.unitPrice`, `Order.total`
- Add granular permissions and default allow rules for all mutations even the anonymous ones
- Add `Mutation.stopImpersonation` that will end an impersonated user account session and return back to the initial impersonator account.
- Add `Query.impersonator` that returns the currently impersonating user in an impersonation session, allowing the client to check if it's in impersonation mode
- Add `Product.reviewsCount`, `User.reviewsCount` & `User.reviews`
- Update `PRODUCT_UPDATE` event to contain the changed product too in the event
- Debounce EventListenerWorker triggered process of the queue to reduce load of Unchained when many items are rolled up

## Patch
- Bump various dependencies and remove more
- Fix landing page
- Fix heartbeat not logging the country context

# Unchained Engine v2.3

We have been working on reducing the bundle size lately and got rid of many third party dependencies. We will not stop here and continue that work. The ultimate goal is to make Unchained run on Deno natively. To achieve, we first have to make the core (`core-` packages) free of third party dependencies and free of Node package dependence and `api` basically only depend on Apollo.

## Minor
- Remove `renderMjmlToHtml` convenience method and pre-defined html templates because mjml is too heavy weight as a dependency and html e-mails cause more issues than they solve.
- Support `MINIO_UPLOAD_PREFIX` to specifiy subdirectory in bucket in front of all uploads
- Remove various dependencies from core packages.
- Make updating of token ownerships more performant
- Improve pricing types
- Support attachment preview in mail debug mode when using absolute file paths
- Update `mutation.impersonate` behavior to enable switching a session to an **impersonated** account and return to the **impersonator** account without the need to logout from the impersonated user account and login again to the initial user (**impersonator**).
Note: By default impersonation is only allowed to **ADMIN** user.
## Patch
- Fix an issue with order pricing
- Fix oder position removal issue #571
- Fix bookmark edge cases #564
- Fix an issue with filters not returned that are selected when they return 0 items
- Fix countryCode not returned in lastLogin field of User


# Unchained Engine v2.2

This release contains various bugfixes and improvements and it breaks various type imports because we are currently in the process of moving types to their respective npm modules.

## Minor
- Extended the input fn option of auto-scheduling `input` to expect a promise and also take the pre-calculated workData as input extending the possibilities to alter auto-scheduling behavior. #588
- Remove `autoSchedulingInput` because there is no obvious way this is helpful and it has never been used in known projects
- Move some platform types to platform package
- The platform option `workQueueOptions` has been extended to take a retryInput. The retryInput fn can be used to alter input into work when the work is beeing retried. This allows stopping retries. #588

## Patch
- Fix timeout field in worker's and types
- Fix mime-type resolves now based on http response in GridFS when downloading from an URL (fallback scenario #559).
- Fix worker not set automatically to the hostname, that was leading to stale external work jobs #561
- Fix reschedule did not cancel old schedules #562


# Unchained Engine v2.1

This release contains various bugfixes and improvements

## Minor
- Add `Mutation.processNextWork` to help trigger work from outside and removed `Mutation.doWork` (was not functional)
- Customize the Cookie Path with `UNCHAINED_COOKIE_PATH`
- Better Order Numbers with Hashid's that don't contain competitive 1,l,0 (O was already removed before)
- Improved logging for the work the queue
- Re-introducded corsOrigins adjustable through `connectPlatformToExpress4`

## Patch
- Fixed various typing bugs
- We found out that a later version of Node.js 16 also supports WHATWG fetch. So the Kitchensink has been made compatible with Node.js 16 again. https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v16.15.0/
- Mail Interceptor can now show some attachments
- Fixed double emitting ORDER_CHECKOUT even
- Fixed not running through customizable product validation fn at checkout
- Fixed a severe GridFS plugin bug that can lead to server crashes (DOS)
- Fixed ERC metadata not optional causing issues with traditional warehousing plugins

# Unchained Engine v2.0 ("Federer")

This is a major feature release bringing Web Authentication API, Web3 Login, Web Push API and Virtual Products including an NFT/Token Minting gateway to Unchained Engine. It's also the first version of Unchained Engine that can be extended to run on other Node.js frameworks than Express.

We are jumping on the ESM train and Unchained Engine 2.0 now requires Node 18+ and uses native fetch. This also breaks Meteor compatibility for the moment. The legacy example will be pinned to v1 for the moment. We will continue to push maintenance and small fixes to both release lines v1.x and v2.x.

## GRAPHQL API BREAKING CHANGES
- Tags are now always LowerCase and use an own scalar
- Order.documents has been removed because it was not used since 3 years
- The fields createdBy, updatedBy, deletedBy and authorId got removed completely from the database and the whole API surface, reasoning behind is that the value most of the time did not represent who actually did what and kept us back using the inner UnchainedCore as type. It just did not deliver on what it promised, it just added bloat. The only place where authorId is still used is in product reviews where users can add reviews and are actual authors of text.

## Major
- New built-in support for two standard W3C API's: Web Authentication API, Push API
- New Web3 Experimantal Features: NFT/Token Minting Plugins, Web3 Login through Metamask
- Unchained now uses Apollo Server 4.
- We have dropped `expressApp` and instead now export a new function `connectPlatformToExpress4`. That Express implementation can be looked up here and is still the default: https://github.com/unchainedshop/unchained/tree/master/packages/api/src/express. The new structure and internals allows somebody to wire the engine with a serverless/lambda environment or any other Node.js based framework.
- `@unchainedshop/plugins` now has a default export and an Express middleware setup function. Using those functions is dramatically simplifying batteries-included setups.  Checkout the kitchensink example's boot.ts which is now less than 60 lines of code. 
- Support out of the box server-side cookies for login and logout tokens when env `UNCHAINED_COOKIE_DOMAIN` is set. The cookie's name which by default is `unchained_token` can be overwritten by using env `UNCHAINED_COOKIE_NAME`. Unchained will still look for cookies even if the domain is not set but in that case the client has to take care of storing and sending the token.
- Extended users and accounts for WebAuthn standard.
- Added API mutations for the WebAuthn module: `Mutation.createWebAuthnCredentialCreationOptions`, `Mutation.createWebAuthnCredentialRequestOptions`,`Mutation.loginWithWebAuthn`,`Mutation.addWebAuthnCredentials`,`User.webAuthnCredentials`.
- A new product type `TokenizedProduct` has been added added that supports NFT's and other virtual products that have no physical representation. They are converted to tokens through a virtual warehouse once checked-out. 
- A new warehousing provider type `VIRTUAL` has been added that allows to define warehouses for virtual products. In the plugin implementation one can define what happens when a user buys a tokenized product thus what kind of tokens get emitted. Further, tokens support a concept we call "exportability" which allows to bridge an Off-chain token to an On-chain token.
- API has been extended to support the new tokenization concept: `User.tokens`, `Mutation.exportToken`, `Query.token`, `Mutation.updateProductTokenization`
- A new ERC Metadata Server is built into Unchained allowing to generate Ethereum compatible ERC-1155 and ERC-721 metadata JSON files for tokenized products.

## Minor
- Currencies now have a field `decimals` to define how many decimals are there. This is needed for general currency conversion between cryptocurrencies and Fiat and also helps to display the amount of arbitrary currencies better on frontends.
- The currency conversion plugin now depends on decimals and works across any currency pairs when there is conversion rates stored.
- Conversion rates are now fetched based on a regular job and not live when needed, this improves performance and stability
- There can now be more than 1 external job type
- The Cryptopay Plugin has been refactored from the ground up and various issues have been fixed

## Patch
- Further limited exposure of data and stacktrace in exceptions
- Fix file upload tests

### Introduction to WebAuthn

You can even register with WebAuthn, login with e registered device or add WebAuthn to an existing user. So get to know the concept, checkout https://webauthn.io

Registration Flow:
```
Added Mutation.createWebAuthnCredentialCreationOptions(username: String!, extensionOptions: JSON): JSON!
Mutation.createUser: added new input field webAuthnPublicKeyCredentials
```

Login Flow:
```
Added Mutation.createWebAuthnCredentialRequestOptions(username: String, extensionOptions: JSON): JSON!
Added Mutation.loginWithWebAuthn(webAuthnPublicKeyCredentials: JSON!): LoginMethodResponse
```

Device Management:
```
Added Mutation.addWebAuthnCredentials(credentials: JSON!): User!
Added Mutation.removeWebAuthnCredentials(credentialsId: ID!): User!
Added User.webAuthnCredentials: [WebAuthnCredentials!]!
```

# Unchained Engine v1.2

Unchained has been converted from Meteor atmosphere packages to ESM npm packages and is now compatible
with most recent Node.js versions and a broad range of builders and webservers like express.js, connect,
next, fastify. Switch even improved bootup performance of meteor apps by 2-3x in dev mode.

To show how that works, we have added a new example "kitchensink" which is a Express.js based Node.js 16
app in ESM mode.

## Breaking Changes

- To upgrade from meteor to NPM with your existing meteor app you will have to:

1. rename all imports prefixed with `meteor/unchained:` to `@unchainedshop/`, then import all the plugins
   from the new `@unchainedshop/plugins` package
2. add the packages to your app's package.json as dependencies
3. remove all unchainedshop atmosphere packages
4. forward the `WebApp.connectHandlers` to the `expressApp` field when starting the server

- `disableEmailInterception` is not available as option anymore, but you can still disable interception
  in development setting the environment variable `UNCHAINED_DISABLE_EMAIL_INTERCEPTION`
- All atmosphere packages have been transformed to npm packages, all plugins are now in a separate
  package `@unchainedshop/plugins`. Check out the kitchensink's boot.ts to see how to load them.
- The payment webhook endpoints changed from
  `/graphql/stripe, /graphql/apple-iap, /graphql/cryptopay, /graphql/postfinance-checkout, /graphql/cryptopay-pricing`
  to
  `/payment/stripe, /payment/apple-iap, /payment/cryptopay, /payment/postfinance-checkout, /pricing/cryptopay`
- Boilerplate has been removed because it was very outdated. A new create-unchained-app version which
  supports the kitchensink will follow suit.
- Controlpanel has been removed because Admin UI is not on-par and can be used by anyone through the new Sandbox App https://sandbox-v3.unchained.shop

## Minor
- [api] Add sort params to Query.orders, Query.quotations, User.orders, User.enrollments, User.quotations
- [docs] Add typedocs and fix controlpanel references
- [core] Improved types

## Patch
- [core] Fix TOTP high severity bug
- [core] Fix SSO with Unchained Cloud
- [core] Fix discount pricing calculation issues
- [core] Fix crash of findProductIds with assortmentId of non-existing assortment


# Unchained Engine v1.1

## Breaking Changes for Plugin Developers

- [core] Instead of `updateDelivery` and `updatePayment` we now have `updateContext` methods on
  order.delivery and order.payment modules respectively, consistent with the rest of the system.
- [core] Pricing Plugins now receive the ongoing director calculation as a sheet in the parameters
  instead of a function that returns a calculation array on the adapter itself, calls like
  `pricingAdapter.calculationSheet()` have to be migrated to `params.calculationSheet`. Else the
  resetCalculation has been moved to the sheet itself and it can take a calculationSheet to revert.
- [core] Discount `actions` in adapter and director now return a Promise to extend the possibility for
  discount plugins to do async work
- [api] `customFields` has been removed from the input field `UserProfileInput` and custom data has been
  moved internally on the user entity from `user.profile.customFields` to `user.meta`

## Minor

- [api] `query.events` is now extended with additional filter parameters `created` get events created
  after the provided event and the previous `selectTypes` field is changed to `types` and accepts array
  of event types. in addition it is now possible to `sort` the results any field on event type
- [api] A new input field `sort` has been added to many generel queries that return lists of something,
  for ex. Query.products
- [api] A new input field `queryString` has been added to many generel queries that return lists of
  something, with this change it's possible to search for an order number through Query.orders for ex.
- [api] new `mutation.updateUserProfile` is extended to accept new argument `meta` to store extra
  information of a user.
- [api] New default queries were added for all kind of "count" cases so you don't have to query a whole
  list just to get the amount of items, this can be quite helpful for pagination: `workQueueCount`,
  `assortmentsCounts`, `countriesCount`, `currenciesCount`, `deliveryProvidersCount`, `filtersCount`,
  `languagesCount`, `logsCount`, `ordersCount`, `paymentProvidersCount`, `productReviewsCount`,
  `productsCount`, `quotationsCount`, `subscriptionsCount`,
  `usersCount`,`warehousingProvidersCount`,`eventsCount`

## Patch

- [core] Improved Typescript Support
- [core] A bug has been fixed that accidentally made order positions immutable for further changes
- [core] A warehousing plugin now get's to know the actual warehousingProvider's ID
- [core] A bug that rendered the Bulk Importer unusable for product media changes has been fixed
- [api] Fix issue with schema not extendable due use of @deprecated on ARGUMENT_DEFINITION

# Unchained Engine v1.0 ("Maiglöggli")

This is our first major release, it covers all features needed to build highly flexible e-commerce
solutions for B2B and B2C cases. Unchained 1.0 is an almost complete rewrite from javascript to
typescript and is many ways breaking existing code based on the older versions. It's also a major step
toward a Meteor-free future of Unchained which will follow suit after this.

Our Roadmap ahead:

- Unchained 1.x (LTS, released until end of autumn, supported until end of 2023): Small continous
  non-breaking improvements to the current version, please see
  https://github.com/unchainedshop/unchained/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3Av1.1 to follow
- Unchained 2.0 (End of 2022): Complete Meteor-free and pure ESM-only version of Unchained Engine that
  runs on edge frameworks.

## Breaking changes

- [core] We have removed the Matomo tracker because it was not a plugin but rather an example of an event
  tracking implementation, it will be re-added later to a "recipes" docs page
- [platform, api, core] Refactor Unchained Engine's core with the goal to add typescript support, get rid
  of classes and reduce the usage of meteor package depedencies to a minimum. This leads to a completely
  new SW architecture. The event director and the databse are initialised in the platform and injected
  into the core modules and services. The modules provide a well-defined module API to manage the data
  and the custom services make use of the modules to fetch and manipulate.
- [core] `UNCHAINED_INVALIDATE_PROVIDERS` has been removed in order for an inverted
  `UNCHAINED_DISABLE_PROVIDER_INVALIDATION`
- [core] NEW core module `core-files` that uses [minio cloud object storage](https://min.io/) compatible
  with [amazon s3 cloud storage api](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). This update provides a scalable files
  storage solution for all the projects that use it. All the previous file management APIs now use this
  module under the hood in addition there are few new endpoint added that support signed put url based
  upload namely `prepareUserAvatarUpload`, `prepareProductMediaUpload`, `prepareAssortmentMediaUpload`
  and `confirmMediaUpload` that can be used to generate signed PUT url for file upload. to learn more on
  how to use this module refer to [docs](https://docs.unchained.shop/). **All existing media's will not
  work anymore and need to be migrated by the developer.**
- [api] `Date` values that previously were returned as timestamps are now converted to UTC compliant with
  the date-time format outlined in section 5.6 of the RFC 3339 profile of the ISO 8601 standard for
  representation of dates and times using the Gregorian calendar to mitigate issues related to timezone.
  while mutations that passed timestamp value will not cause an issue, the frontend code that expects
  UNIX timestamp value for the `DateTime` value needs to be updated. this included but not only -
  `created`, `updated`, `deleted` values on all entities that previously exposed this fields -
  `order.ordered`, `order.confirmed` - `product.published` - `quotation.expires`, `quotation.fulfilled`,
  `quotation.rejected` - `subscription.updated`
- [core] Upgrade to new GraphQL multi-part standard with graphql-upload pinning to v12, please use the
  latest graphql-upload-client
- [core] Environment variables `LANG`, `COUNTRY` & `CURRENCY` have to be prefixed with `UNCHAINED_` to
  prevent a conflict that may occur with other systems environment variables.
- [core] upsertLocalizedText for products and assortments does not automatically change the slug anymore,
  explicitly set it by providing a slug property
- [core] Remove cron worker `@unchainedshop/core-worker/workers/cron`, use the interval worker instead
- [core] `cronText` has been removed from `configureAutoscheduling` in favor of `schedule`, `schedule`
  has to be a later.js compliant schedule definition. If you want to reuse the custom cronText define
  schedule like `later.parse.text('every 5 mins');` Likewise `autoSchedulingCronText` has been removed
  from subscription settings and replaced with `autoSchedulingSchedule`
- [core] `core-subscriptions` package is now obsolete and a new `core-enrollments` package with the same
  functionality has been added. This is to counterfeit problems with GraphQL Subscriptions from the spec.
- [api] The meta field has been removed, this will affect the following types that previously had a
  `meta` field
  ```
  Assortment.meta
  AssortmentProduct.meta
  AssortmentFilter.meta
  AssortmentLink.meta
  Media.meta
  Product.meta
  ProductReview.meta
  ProductReviewVote.meta
  Quotation.meta
  Subscription.meta
  SubscriptionDelivery.meta
  SubscriptionPayment.meta
  Order.meta
  OrderDelivery.meta
  OrderPayment.meta
  ```
- [schema] SPECIAL ATTENTION REQUIRED: `Money` type has been completely removed and was replaced with
  `Price`, this simplifies reading out prices but involves changing potentially a lot of FRONTEND CODE!.
  This change will affect the following types and any other type that has fields of this types

  ```
  ProductPrice.price
  ProductDiscount.total
  DeliveryFee.price
  Order.total
  OrderDelivery.fee
  OrderDiscountable.total
  OrderDiscount.total
  OrderItem.unitPrice
  OrderItem.total
  OrderPayment.fee
  ```

## Major

- [core] Bulk Importer now supports skipping the built-in cache invalidation run at the end by using
  `skipCacheInvalidation`
- [core] Bulk Importer now supports defining custom entities to sync
- [api] Product, Assortment & Filter texts are now loaded through a Dataloader which improves Performance
- [api] A new `RANGE` filter type has been added. A range filter parses filter query values differently
  in searchProducts than MULTI_SELECT and allows to do open-end filtering on decimal values by using `:`.
  As an example, `0:500` will match all option values between 0 and 500.
- [core] Assortment to Product Id cache now resides in a special collection to optimize performance and
  can be further customized to cache these caches in a custom cache module. See new settings in
  assortments: `setCachedProductIds` & `getCachedProductIds`
- [examples] Updated Meteor to latest version 2.4 from 2.2 for the minimal project (see
  https://docs.meteor.com/changelog.html#v2420210915)
- [api] Added support for Two Factor Auth with TOTP:
  ```
  Mutation.buildSecretTOTPAuthURL
  Mutation.disableTOTP
  Mutation.enableTOTP
  User.isTwoFactorEnabled
  ```
- [core] We have added a new Datatrans v2 plugin which is based on the new Datatrans JSON based API and
  allows advanced integration processes like marketplace fee splits and secure fields. Datatrans v2 will
  always use deferred settlement mode when possible, this makes it almost impossible to have the "order
  checkout failed but still charged" issue that was possible before depending on how the payment process
  was implemented client-side, leading to manual work and potential client frustration.
- [core] orderNumber, quotationNumber and enrollmentNumber generation can now be customized, see config
- [controlpanel] Now it's possible to add external links to an extended version of Unchained Admin UI or
  any other site you want to access through the `controlpanel` by providing JSON using the env
  `EXTERNAL_LINKS` variable inside `example/minimal`. The JSON to be provided has to be an array of
  external link definitions in the form of objects with href and title properties
  (`[{ href: string, title: string}]`). If an external link file object is found its content will appear
  in the top menu of the `controlpanel`
- [api] `query.productReviews` is extended to support searching/filtering with title or review and
  sorting all valid fields of product review.
- [api] New mutation `logoutAllSession` added that can be used to remove all tokens of current user
- [platform] Assortment bulk import updated to handle assortment media.
- [api,core] Add support for remotePort and userAgent in context and heartbeat #118
- [api,core,controlpanel] Users with admin roles can now search for specific orders by
  userId,orderId,orderNumber & status through the controlpanel #319
- [core] NEW core module `events` allows to listen to various elementary events and trigger custom code
  based on those. See the documentation here https://docs.unchained.shop/config/events/. We also provide
  two default event backend integrations, one for the local Node.js event emitter and one for Redis. In
  some cases you will only want to react to an event on a worker instance or even completely fire and
  forget and let another software pick up the events, for these cases we strongly suggest to use the
  Redis plugin. An additional MongoDB based event log is available through queries and can be inspected
  through the controlpanel. We will drop support for the MongoDB logging in the future so please make
  sure that you don't tail the Unchained Logs collection, consider migrating to `events` instead.
- [core] `simulatePriceRange` and `catalogPriceRange` helpers added that will return price range of
  products variations assigned for a particular configurable(proxy) product based on the parameters
  provided to them.
- [core] Now experimental it's possible to ensure users to always have a cart assigned to them by setting
  the module config option `ensureUserHasCart` on the orders module to true.
- [core] The query `workQueue` now allows to further narrow the result set based on a creation date range
- [api] We have added a special mutation called `pageView` that you can use to trigger server-side
  pageView tracking events. That way you can connect Unchained with Trackers like Google Analytics or
  Matomo in a private way without cookies.
- [api] New mutation.signPaymentProviderForCheckout to sign generic order payment directly
  (OrderPayment.sign still works but is marked deprecated and will be removed in future major releases)
- [api] three new fields added `ConfigurableProduct.simulatedPriceRange` ,
  `ConfigurableProduct.catalogPriceRange`, `SimulateProduct.leveledCatalogPrices`
  `PlanProduct.leveledCatalogPrices`
- [platform] Additionally related with the above feature it's possible to assign carts for all existing
  users in the system at boot time by passing `assignCartForUsers` boolean value to `startPlafom` or
  using the environment variable `UNCHAINED_ASSIGN_CART_FOR_USERS`
- [platform] You can now disable the invalidation of orders at boot time by passing `invalidateProviders`
  boolean value to `startPlafom` or using the environment variable
  `UNCHAINED_DISABLE_PROVIDER_INVALIDATION`. You can also control the max age so that very old carts are
  not invalidated forever with `providerInvalidationMaxAgeDays`.
- [core] It's is now possible to assign media files for assortments.
- [controlpanel] Assortment media upload, remove & reorder functionalities are available.
- [api] Added the following query and mutations that can be used to manage assortment medias

```
Query.translatedAssortmentMediaTexts
Mutation.addAssortmentMedia
Mutation.removeAssortmentMedia
Mutation.reorderAssortmentMedia
Mutation.updateAssortmentMediaText
AssortmentMediaTexts
AssortmentMedia
UpdateAssortmentMediaTextInput
ReorderAssortmentMediaInput
```

- [core] New module `products.prices.rates` for currency rates and a generic `ProductPriceRateConversion`
  plugin that consumes these rates.
- [core] New Cryptopay pricing and payment plugin to support the self-hosted, decentralized Crypto
  Payment Gateway for payments in BTC, ETH, and arbitrary ERC20 tokens.

  an order with status `PENDING`.
- [core] New
  [Worldline Saferpay](https://www.six-payment-services.com/de/site/e-commerce/learn-more/merchant.html)
  payment plugin.

## Minor

- [core] accountsjs's accountsPassword and accountsServer options can now be configured through the
  normal module configuration of unchained by providing `server` and `password` objects with options.
- [core] The logging of payment providers has been streamlined and is now more verbose by default to help
  track down payment issues

# v0.61.1

This is a bugfix release based on learnings from upgrading client projects

## Breaking changes

- [api] Fix `logout` regression with not falling back to the current token when used without explicit
  token
- [core] `Users.createUser` now sends messages by default, you have to explicitly bail out by either
  providing an option `skipMessaging` to true or set the new `autoMessagingAfterUserCreation` module
  param of users to `false`. Take a look at your seed scripts.
- [platform] Certain fields like `emails` and `services` are now blocked from passing to
  `Users.createUser`. If you have used `emails` in `createUser` seeding before, use email. If you want to
  skip e-mail verification forcefully, use `initialPassword: true`. See the changes in the minimal
  example seed file to get a glimpse.

  functions except for the function that loads all modules in order and ties together the typescript
  types
- [roles] Roles package got refactored only keeping a fraction of the previous APIs. We are currently
  rebuilding parts of Unchained under the hood with a new code structure that helps developers to easily
  add new resolvers and access the core API's through typescript types

# v0.55.0

Attention: If you have used Meteor Accounts specific extensions to extend login functionalities for your
Unchained-based project, you will have to rewrite all code that depends on Meteor's accounts packages and
extend the functionality through accounts-js config, strategies and hooks
(<https://www.accountsjs.com/docs/introduction>).

Look for `Accounts.registerLoginHandler`, `Accounts.onLogin` or Meteor Accounts Password based features
like `Accounts.setUsername` or `Accounts.setPassword` to find out if you are affected.

## Breaking Changes

- [api] Auth-related Errors in signup, signin, lost password etc. have other Error Codes now. See
  https://www.accountsjs.com/docs/api/server/globals#enumerations for more information.
- [users] `addEmail` and `updateEmail` no longer send out email verification; you need to trigger the
  verification using `sendVerificationEmail` mutation.

  to solve various issues with frontends and services that don't accept addresses like `user@toplevel`.
  Also it's now very important to seed your database AFTER startPlatform.

You have to remove meteor's native accounts packages from the project to use the new unchained version:

```
meteor remove accounts-base accounts-password accounts-oauth
```

## Minor

- [users] `sendEnrollmentEmail` mutation is now available to trigger enrollment emails.
- [api] Enhanced Query.users which now allows to query for users with a fulltext search that takes E-mail
  addresses into account

## Breaking Changes

New Exceptions: A new exception handling #188 now consistently throws much more intelligent errors with
machine-readable error codes than before. This is potentially breaking if you were evaluating the errors
thrown in GraphQL Mutations and Queries before.

Datalayer changes: The following functions now require an authorId to work properly:

New factory methods to create new Entities (please don't use Entity.insert anymore if you're writing sync
code!), they also require authorId now:

- Countries.createCountry
- Currencies.createCurrency
- Languages.createLanguage
- ProductVariations.createVariation
- ProductMedia.createMedia

# v0.51.0

Contributions by: @harryadelb, @Mikearaya & @pozylon

## Breaking Changes

We will rename all unchained core specific env variables and prefix them with UNCHAINED\_ in the future,
for now:

- [api] Siblings return only active products by default now
- [payment] The existing Stripe v1 plugin has been removed because it was unsafe to use and depended on
  an old API
- [messaging] The architecture of the messaging core plugin has been completely revamped, also the
  default notification e-mail templates are now loaded as part of the platform package reducing the
  boilerplate code needed when bootstrapping a fresh Unchained project. For example the send-mail
  delivery provider cannot be used anymore due to refactoring of the messaging system. There is a new one
  ("send-message") that needs to be used for this case.
- [api] assignments behaves now exactly the same as products, returning only assignments with active
  products if not specified explicitly with includeInactive = true

## Minor

- [api] Product.siblings now support a parameter "includeInactive" to return inactive products (same like
  for Assortment.products & search)
- [filters] Search now supports a new parameter "ignoreChildAssortments". When activated it will only
  consider directly linked products for search, ignoring sub-assortment products.
- [messaging] New Messaging (#163)
- [filter] The filter plugins are now also called when the queryString is empty, allowing cases like
  user-specific hiding or showing of products system-wide
- [cp] It's now possible to search for products (#178 )
- [tests] Added a whole lot of integration tests (#177 , #176 , #175, #174)
- [api] Improve error reporting when id's (filters, products) don't exist when provided to a mutation
- [payment] Apple In-App-Purchase has landed, supporting stored credentials (#173)
- [payment] Stripe v2 has landed, supporting stored credentials (#179)
- [payment, delivery] Allow to further customize supported providers #161
- Improve performance by using lru-caches at bottleneck points throughout the system
- [worker] It's now possible to define an autoscheduling rule for jobs and the system automatically takes
  care of setting up the jobs

## Patch

- [examples] Fix a regression bug (simple-schema / seeds) when trying to start the minimal example the
  first time
- [ci] Skip caching in CI and dev
- [cp] Various small ui fixes
- [platform] Fixes carts on bootup when a delivery / payment provider is not valid anymore.
- [great-purge-of-meteor] Remove aldeed:index

# v0.48.0

## Breaking Changes

We will rename all Unchained core specific env variables and prefix them with UNCHAINED\_ in the future,
for now:

- The Environment variable DISABLE_WORKER has been renamed to UNCHAINED_DISABLE_WORKER
- The Environment variable WORKER_ID has been renamed to UNCHAINED_WORKER_ID
- The Environment variable WORKER_CRON_TEXT has been removed, provide `cronText` as option to
  startPlatform to configure, use your own env var if still needed.
- The Environment variable FIXTURES has been removed, we will remove the fixtures and faker helpers in
  the future.
- [platform] These 3 worker plugins are automatically loaded and started: EventListenerWorker,
  CronWorker, FailedRescheduler. Please remove the worker boot code from your project like this:
  <https://github.com/unchainedshop/unchained/commit/89278ce018bcc8ef5861e60f91cf5fde9d2caec9#diff-0f4e94ac3eacf892b0b4f09738a49635>
- [api] `getCart` now returns a promise
- [users] the `orders` helper now returns a promise
- [payment] Signature of sign changed slightly, takes transactionContext in first property
- [api] User.lastDeliveryAddress has been removed (was never implemented right)
- [payment] Signature of charge changed slightly, takes the order as order in first property

## Minor

- [subscriptions] Introduce Subscriptions Core Module: Please see PR #158
- [payment,user,subscriptions] Stored Credentials: The Payment and User modules have been enhanced to
  support storing payment credentials like creditcards, tokens or aliases used to do fast checkouts. PR
  #158
- [api] All product types now support siblings
- [payment] Datatrans plugin supports aliasing for subscriptions
- [worker] The worker now supports recurring jobs and exposes `configureAutoscheduling` that allows to
  run a specific plugin continously, first used by subscriptions generating orders at a specific rate
- [platform] startPlatform now supports module specific configuration
- [worker] Heartbeat worker supports waiting for a timeout before completion (helpful for integration
  tests)
- [examples] The Dockerfile in minimal now supports proper layer caching and speeds up builds in CI if
  supported by the CI system and the dependencies did not change.
- [assortments] The zipTree function of assortments can now be configured with
  `modules.assortments.zipTree`
- [delivery] It's now possible to customize the sort order of supported delivery providers
  `modules.delivery.sortProviders`
- [payment] It's now possible to customize the sort order of supported payment providers
  `modules.payment.sortProviders`
- [filters] Filters now fallback to no invalidation on startup if not configured
- [logs] Added an index on the created field for logs and also make the log collection expire with a
  MongoDB native feature (<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/expire-data/>). This should improve
  db log performance and disk usage

## Patch

- [api] Fixes removeDiscount regression crashing apollo
- [worker] Now experimental interval worker which does not depend on SyncedCron
- [examples] Various Fixes in Controlpanel
- [examples] Various console output and lint issues
- [tests] Fixed various tests
