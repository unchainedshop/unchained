# vNext

- [api] New mutation.signPaymentProviderForCheckout to sign generic order payment directly (OrderPayment.sign still works but is marked deprecated and will be removed in future major releases)

# v0.61.1

This is a bugfix release based on learnings from upgrading client projects

## Breaking changes

- [core] `Users.createUser` now sends messages by default, you have to explicitly bail out by either providing an option `skipMessaging` to true or set the new `autoMessagingAfterUserCreation` module param of users to `false`. Take a look at your seed scripts.
- [platform] Certain fields like `emails` and `services` are now blocked from passing to `Users.createUser`. If you have used `emails` in `createUser` seeding before, use email. If you want to skip e-mail verification forcefully, use `initialPassword: true`. See the changes in the minimal example seed file to get a glimpse.

## Minor

- [examples] Fix minimal example not seeding
- [api] Fix children not receiving includeInactive
- [core] Fix core not receiving module configuration of users
- [core] Fix Assortments.sync always auto publishing all assortments
- [platform] Fix broken cart migration

# v0.61.0

This is a bugfix release based on learnings from upgrading client projects

## Breaking changes

- [api] Removes filterContext and evalContext
- [core] Enrollment E-Mails are sent automatically when `enrollUser` is used with an empty password

## Minor

- [api] Re-introduce `context` field to startPlatform, allowing access to the unchained context function so it's possible to adjust the Apollo Server context freely
- [core] Fix regression with forced sortKey parameters when modifying links, filters or products
- [core] Fix regression with enrollment of users triggering verification e-mail #307
- [core] Sends custom AccountsJs Hooks `LoginTokenCreated` and `VerifyEmailSuccess` to hook into E-Mail verification (re-enables features based on that prior Unchained < 0.61.0)

# v0.60.0

We are currently rebuilding parts of Unchained under the hood with a new code structure that helps developers to easily add new resolvers and access the core API's through typescript types.

## Breaking Changes

- [api] `Mutation.setBaseLanguage` removed, base language now set through env `LANG`
- [api] `Mutation.setBaseCountry` removed, base language now set through env `COUNTRY`

- [core] `findProviderById` & `findReviewById` removed
- [core] You cannot `import 'meteor/unchained:core-worker/plugins/heartbeat'` anymore without typescript package
- [api] NotFoundErrors have been removed from various queries which return an optional single entity, like Query.product(...): Product #299, affects `Query.country`, `Query.currency`, `Query.deliveryProvider`, `Query.filter`, `Query.language`, `Query.order`, `Query.paymentProvider`, `Query.product`, `Query.productCatalogPrices`, `Query.productReview`, `Query.quotation`, `Query.searchProducts (assortmentId)`, `Query.subscription`, `Query.user`, `Query.warehousingProvider`, `Query.work`

- [roles] Roles package got refactored only keeping a fraction of the previous APIs.
 We are currently rebuilding parts of Unchained under the hood with a new code structure that helps developers to easily add new resolvers and access the core API's through typescript types
- [api,core] Business logic and db calls are now wrapped in functions and moved from api to the core packages
- [pricing] New open-source pricing plugins:
  - - EUR catalog price auto conversion with ECB rates
  - - Crypto catalog price auto conversion with Coinbase rates
  - - Mercantile Rounding
- [payment] Our official Datatrans plugin now supports all different security modes for signing a transaction through env `DATATRANS_SECURITY` and `DATATRANS_SIGN2_KEY`.

- [platform] If you used `Users.createUser` before, that function is now async
- [api] setPassword mutation now also supports plain passwords if needed.

## Patches

- [controlpanel] Fix bug in Currency edit form
- [controlpanel] Fix bug with Assortment list not showing the assortments

# v0.55.0

Attention: If you have used Meteor Accounts specific extensions to extend login functionalities for your unchained-based project, you will have to rewrite all code that depends on Meteor's accounts packages and extend the functionality through accounts-js config, strategies and hooks (<https://www.accountsjs.com/docs/introduction>).

Look for `Accounts.registerLoginHandler`, `Accounts.onLogin` or Meteor Accounts Password based features like `Accounts.setUsername` or `Accounts.setPassword` to find out if you are affected.

## Breaking Changes

- [users] `addEmail` and `updateEmail` no longer send out email verification; you need to trigger the verification using `sendVerificationEmail` mutation.
- [users] `enrollUser` doesn't send out the enrollment email by default anymore. You need to trigger it using `sendEnrollmentEmail` mutation.
- [api] The functions `getConnection` and `callMethod` have been removed
- [api] `Mutation.resendVerificationEmail` has been renamed to `Mutation.sendVerificationEmail`
- [api] More specific exceptions when using wrong Id's
- [platform] New unchained instances now generate an admin user with an E-Mail of `admin@unchained.local` to solve various issues with frontends and services that don't accept addresses like `user@toplevel`. Also it's now very important to seed your database AFTER startPlatform.

You have to remove meteor's native accounts packages from the project to use the new unchained version:

```
meteor remove accounts-base accounts-password accounts-oauth
```

## Minor

- [users] `sendEnrollmentEmail` mutation is now available to trigger enrollment emails.
- [api] Enhanced Query.users which now allows to query for users with a fulltext search that takes E-mail addresses into account
- [api] Better integration tests that cover more business logic than before

## Patches

- [great-purge-of-meteor] Remove accounts-base and accounts-password from platform package
- [great-purge-of-meteor] Implement new accountsjs package
- [great-purge-of-meteor] Convert all authentication related mutations within `api/resolvers/mutations/accounts/loginWithPassword.js` to use accounts-js.
- [great-purge-of-meteor] Convert any Users collection helpers to use accounts-js.
- [api] Fixed an issue which prevented Query.subscription from working at all
- [assortments] Fixed an issue that resulted in totally wrong breadcrumbs in some special edge case (assortmentPaths)

<https://docs.unchained.shop>

Contributions by: @Mikearaya @harryadel @schmidsi @pozylon

## Breaking Changes

New Exceptions: A new exception handling #188 now consistently throws much more intelligent errors with machine-readable error codes than before. This is potentially breaking if you were evaluating the errors thrown in GraphQL Mutations and Queries before.

Datalayer changes:
The following functions now require an authorId to work properly:

- Assortments.createAssortment
- assortment.addProduct
- assortment.addLink
- assortment.addFilter

New factory methods to create new Entities (please don't use Entity.insert anymore if you're writing sync code!), they also require authorId now:

- Countries.createCountry
- Currencies.createCurrency
- Languages.createLanguage
- ProductVariations.createVariation
- ProductMedia.createMedia

Changes to Filter Plugins: The async method search on a FilterAdapter is now searchProducts (!). Additionally it's possible to override full-text search of Assortments through searchAssortments.

# v0.51.0

Contributions by: @harryadelb, @Mikearaya & @pozylon

## Breaking Changes

We will rename all unchained core specific env variables and prefix them with UNCHAINED\_ in the future, for now:

- [api] Siblings return only active products by default now
- [payment] The existing Stripe v1 plugin has been removed because it was unsafe to use and depended on an old API
- [messaging] The architecture of the messaging core plugin has been completely revamped, also the default notification e-mail templates are now loaded as part of the platform package reducing the boilerplate code needed when bootstrapping a fresh unchained project. For example the send-mail delivery provider cannot be used anymore due to refactoring of the messaging system. There is a new one ("send-message") that needs to be used for this case.
- [api] assignments behaves now exactly the same as products, returning only assignments with active products if not specified explicitly with includeInactive = true

## Minor

- [api] Product.siblings now support a parameter "includeInactive" to return inactive products (same like for Assortment.products & search)
- [filters] Search now supports a new parameter "ignoreChildAssortments". When activated it will only consider directly linked products for search, ignoring sub-assortment products.
- [messaging] New Messaging (#163)
- [filter] The filter plugins are now also called when the queryString is empty, allowing cases like user-specific hiding or showing of products system-wide
- [cp] It's now possible to search for products (#178 )
- [tests] Added a whole lot of integration tests (#177 , #176 , #175, #174)
- [api] Improve error reporting when id's (filters, products) don't exist when provided to a mutation
- [payment] Apple In-App-Purchase has landed, supporting stored credentials (#173)
- [payment] Stripe v2 has landed, supporting stored credentials (#179)
- [payment, delivery] Allow to further customize supported providers #161
- Improve performance by using lru-caches at bottleneck points throughout the system
- [worker] It's now possible to define an autoscheduling rule for jobs and the system automatically takes care of setting up the jobs

## Patches

- [examples] Fix a regression bug (simple-schema / seeds) when trying to start the minimal example the first time
- [ci] Skip caching in CI and dev
- [cp] Various small ui fixes
- [platform] Fixes carts on bootup when a delivery / payment provider is not valid anymore.
- [great-purge-of-meteor] Remove aldeed:index

---

# v0.48.0

## Breaking Changes

We will rename all unchained core specific env variables and prefix them with UNCHAINED\_ in the future, for now:

- The Environment variable DISABLE_WORKER has been renamed to UNCHAINED_DISABLE_WORKER
- The Environment variable WORKER_ID has been renamed to UNCHAINED_WORKER_ID
- The Environment variable WORKER_CRON_TEXT has been removed, provide `cronText` as option to startPlatform to configure, use your own env var if still needed.
- The Environment variable FIXTURES has been removed, we will remove the fixtures and faker helpers in the future.
- [platform] These 3 worker plugins are automatically loaded and started: EventListenerWorker, CronWorker, FailedRescheduler. Please remove the worker boot code from your project like this: <https://github.com/unchainedshop/unchained/commit/89278ce018bcc8ef5861e60f91cf5fde9d2caec9#diff-0f4e94ac3eacf892b0b4f09738a49635>

- [payment,user,subscriptions] Stored Credentials: The Payment and User modules have been enhanced to support storing payment credentials like creditcards, tokens or aliases used to do fast checkouts. PR #158
- [api] All product types now support siblings
- [payment] Datatrans plugin supports aliasing for subscriptions
- [worker] The worker now supports recurring jobs and exposes `configureAutoscheduling` that allows to run a specific plugin continously, first used by subscriptions generating orders at a specific rate
- [platform] startPlatform now supports module specific configuration
- [worker] Heartbeat worker supports waiting for a timeout before completion (helpful for integration tests)
- [examples] The Dockerfile in minimal now supports proper layer caching and speeds up builds in CI if supported by the CI system and the dependencies did not change.
- [assortments] The zipTree function of assortments can now be configured with `modules.assortments.zipTree`
- [delivery] It's now possible to customize the sort order of supported delivery providers `modules.delivery.sortProviders`
- [payment] It's now possible to customize the sort order of supported payment providers `modules.payment.sortProviders`
- [filters] Filters now fallback to no invalidation on startup if not configured
- [logs] Added an index on the created field for logs and also make the log collection expire with a mongodb native feature (<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/expire-data/>). This should improve db log performance and disk usage
