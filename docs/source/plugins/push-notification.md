description: Configuring W3C based push notification service

Push notifications are a powerful tool for communicating with users even when your website is not currently open in their browser. The W3C Web Platform API provides the Push API and Notifications API, which allows you to send push notifications to users who have granted permission.

To set up push notifications, you'll need to generate a private and public key pair, which will be used to authenticate your service. Once you have the key pair, you'll need to assign the values to environment variables:

- `PUSH_NOTIFICATION_PUBLIC_KEY`: This will hold the public key value that you need to register with the push service.
- `PUSH_NOTIFICATION_PRIVATE_KEY`: This will hold the private key value that you need to use to sign the push messages.

in order to communicate the required vapid key with the store front unchained exposes the value registered on the shop graphql field.

```graphql
shopInfo {
    vapidPublicKey
  }

```
`vapidPublicKey` holds the same value you provided for `PUSH_NOTIFICATION_PUBLIC_KEY` because it's needed for signing in client side.

To manage a user's push subscriptions, you can use the following mutations:

- `addPushSubscription(subscription: JSON!, unsubscribeFromOtherUsers: Boolean)`: Attaches a push subscription object to a user if doesn't already exists. it also accepts a optional parameter to remove other subscriptions from the same application.
-  `removePushSubscription(p256dh: String!)`: removes a push subscription object of a user from the application identified by the `p256dh`.

All the push subscription of a user are are exposed through `user.pushSubscriptions`


```graphql
type PushSubscription {
  _id: ID! // p256dh value of the registered application
  endpoint: String!
  expirationTime: Int
  userAgent: String
}

```

The push notification worker automatically picks up any work items with type `PUSH` and sends them for you.
Note that even if the user enabled push notification Email notification will also be triggered along with each notification because push notification might not be viewed or noticed by a user at the time of sending.

# Configuration

## Trigger

Triggering a push notification is not any different from sending email since the push service is just another worker. so for additional resource look at [Configuring email template](../config/email-template/).

the only difference is push notification worker expects a input type that is slightly different. bellow are all the input values accepted,
- `subscription`: actual user subscription object stored. it should have the following structure

```
 {
  endpoint: string;
  expirationTime?: number;
  keys: {
    auth: string;
    p256dh: string;
  }
```
- `subject (required) `: url or the site the message is going to be sent.
- `payload (required)`: stringified JSON object with `title` and `body` keys of the message,
- `urgency`:  is to indicate to the push service whether to send the notification immediately or prioritize the recipientâ€™s device power considerations for delivery. Provide one of the following values: `very-low`, `low`, `normal`, or `high`. To attempt to deliver the notification immediately, specify `high`
- `topic`: optionally provide an identifier that the push service uses to coalesce notifications. Use a maximum of 32 characters from the URL or filename-safe Base64 characters sets.


Here is an example template resolver that will trigger a PUSH notification to a user if they are subscribed

```js
import { MessagingDirector } from "@unchainedshop/core-messaging";
export const helloThere: TemplateResolver = async (
  {  },
  context: UnchainedCore
) => {
  const { modules, userId } = context;

  const user = await modules.users.findUserById(userId);
  

  const pushNotifications =
      ? (user?.pushSubscriptions || [])?.map(({ ...subscription }) => ({
  type: "PUSH",
  input: {
    subscription,
    subject: "https://unchained.shop",
    payload: JSON.stringify({
      body: "Enjoy your unchained engine",
      title: "Welcome",              
    })
  },
}))
      : [];

  return [
    ...pushNotifications,
  ].filter(Boolean);
};


MessagingDirector.registerTemplate('ACCOUNT_ACTION', helloThere);

```
