description: How to use the built-in Event system
---

Unchained supports the publish-subscribe (pub/sub) event model to keep track of events emitted in each module. By default it uses nodejs EventEmitter module to handle events but the system can be extended to connect to distributed event queues.

You can subscribe to events to trigger any custom logic you can think of. It is especially useful to track data server-side for analytics purposes or to trigger additional e-mails based on special workflows.

The `@unchainedshop/core-events` module exports three utility functions that can be used to interact with the registered event tracker, or register new custom events.

- `registerEvents`: adds custom events that will be tracked. it takes array of event names.
- `emit(eventName, payload)`: used to emit events, either pre-built events or custom events registered using `registerEvents`. It takes two arguments, name of the event we want to emit and an object of the data associated with the event.
- `subscribe(eventName: callback)`: used for subscribing to events emitted by `emit` function. It takes two arguments, name of the event we want to subscribe to and a call back that will take one argument holding data for the associated event.

Note: to get list of pre-built or custom events registered on unchained use `EventType` resolver inside GraphQL playground.

Every event emitted from the engine is an object that has one property `payload` which is also an object that has different properties based on the event. We recommend you follow the same pattern when implementing custom events.

## Built-in Events

Below are events tracked under each module under the box:

### Tracking custom events

In addition to the built in event that come with unchained you can register your own custom event easily.

In order to do this, The custom events need to be registered at platform boot time using `registerEvents` helper function that takes array of event names to be tracked.

```
import { registerEvents } from '@unchainedshop/core-events';

...
startPlatform({...});
...
registerEvents([
  'CUSTOM_EVENT_ONE',
  'CUSTOM_EVENT_TWO',
  'CUSTOM_EVENT_THREE',
])
```

After initializing this at system start up, you can `emit` and `subscribe` in your code base.

```
import { registerEvents } from '@unchainedshop/core-events';

subscribe('CUSTOM_EVENT_ONE', ({ payload }) => {
    console.log(payload.from);
});

emit('CUSTOM_EVENT_ONE', { from: "fcustom event one"});;


```

NOTE: before you can subscribe to an event, make sure it's registered first. Otherwise error will be thrown.
