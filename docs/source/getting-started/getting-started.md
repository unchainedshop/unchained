> This tutorial walks you through installing and configuring Unchained Engine.
> If you're just getting started with GraphQL or Node.js this will be too hard to follow

This tutorial helps you:

- Obtain a basic understanding of the architecture
- Bootstrap a basic unchained backed project
- Write a pricing plugin
- Deploy an Unchained engine backed the project

This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the command line and
JavaScript, and that you have a recent version of Node.js 16+ installed.

# Building custom unchained engine

Extending an Unchained engine is simple as adding a plugin that is easier to understand and implement. to make it even easier we have created a bare bone Unchained template you can use as a starting point.

in this section, we will walk through the steps required to start up a custom Unchained engine locally and connecting it to a storefront to perform the task.

## Step 1: Create a new project

1.  Initialize a new Unchained project with `npm` (or another package manager you prefer, such as Yarn):

```bash
mkdir your-awesome-ecommerce-project
cd your-awesome-ecommerce-project

npm init @unchainedshop

npm run install-all
```

The above command will pull a boilerplate Unchained engine instance and a storefront that connects with it out of the box in your local environment.

Your project directory now contains the following services:

- **engine**: Contains a boilerplate Unchained engine
- **storefront**: Contains a Next. js-based Web App that connects to Unchained.

before you can run the instance locally there are few environment variables you need to set for each service.

create a `.env` file under the root directory of both `engine` and `storefront` then add the following value accordingly.

For the engine environment even though there are many environment variables you can set which we will describe later, the following is the required one.

```
SUPPRESS_ENV_ERRORS=
```

Next under the root directory of storefront create a `.env` file and add the following environment variable.

```
UNCHAINED_ENDPOINT=https://localhost:4010/graphql
```

Not you can customize the above value once you get accustomed to the inner working of unchained.

Finally, the only thing remaining is firing up unchained sees its work in action. to do so go to the projects root directory and run

```
npm run dev
```

Now you have a fully running Unchained E-Commerce environment running locally. Check it out by browsing to the following URLs:

- http://localhost:3000 to see the front-end (storefront)
- http://localhost:4010 to see the admin UI. Login with username: admin@unchained.local / password: password
- http://localhost:4010/graphql to see the Unchained GraphQL Playground

## Step 2: Write a custom pricing plugin

Next, we will add a new file to the project and name it `engine/sausage.js`:

```js
import { ProductPricingDirector, ProductPricingAdapter } from '@unchainedshop/core-pricing'

const PRODUCT_TAG_SAUSAGE = 'sausage'
const SAUSAGE_THRESHOLD_CELSIUS = 20

class WeatherDependentBarbequeSausagePricing extends ProductPricingAdapter {
  static key = 'shop.unchained.wd-bbq-sausage-pricing'
  static version = '1.0'
  static label = 'Calculate the price of a sausage ðŸŒ­ðŸŒ¦'
  static orderIndex = 3

  static isActivatedFor({ product }) {
    if (product.tags && product.tags.length > 0 && product.tags.indexOf(PRODUCT_TAG_SAUSAGE) !== -1) {
      return true
    }
    return false
  }

  async calculate() {
    const { currency, quantity } = this.context
    try {
      const response = await fetch(
        'https://community-open-weather-map.p.rapidapi.com/weather?q=zurich,ch&units=metric',
        {
          headers: {
            'x-rapidapi-key': '2a849e288dmsh59370f28a9102f6p1c881cjsn28010ce8ff58',
            'x-rapidapi-host': 'community-open-weather-map.p.rapidapi.com',
            useQueryString: true,
          },
        },
      )
      if (response.status === 200) {
        const { main } = await response.json()
        const { temp } = main
        if (temp) {
          if (temp > SAUSAGE_THRESHOLD_CELSIUS) {
            console.log('ðŸŒ­ -> High season, sausage pricy!!') // eslint-disable-line
            this.result.addItem({
              currency,
              amount: 100 * quantity,
              isTaxable: true,
              isNetPrice: true,
              meta: { adapter: this.constructor.key },
            })
          }
        }
      }
    } catch (e) {
      console.error(`ðŸŒ­ -> Failed while trying to price weather dependent ${e.message}`) // eslint-disable-line
    }

    return super.calculate()
  }
}

ProductPricingDirector.registerAdapter(WeatherDependentBarbequeSausagePricing)
```

When you read through the code you can anticipate the domain logic: All products that have the tag "sausage" will get 1 CHF more expensive when a certain temperature threshold has been reached at a specific location.

Now let's load that plugin in `engine/boot.js`

```
import "./sausage";
```

# Build the Storefront

## Step 3: Create a new product

Now open the admin UI and add a new product, tag it with "sausage", set a price, and publish it. As always you can use GraphQL mutations to do that:

```graphql
mutation {
  createProduct(product: { type: "SimpleProduct", title: "Cervelat", tags: "sausage" }) {
    _id
  }
}
```

```graphql
mutation {
  updateProductCommerce(
    productId: "dKn2dvfqjiiJ6DbJA"
    commerce: { pricing: [{ currencyCode: "CHF", countryCode: "CH", amount: 200 }] }
  ) {
    ... on SimpleProduct {
      simulatedPrice {
        price {
          amount
        }
      }
    }
  }
  publishProduct(productId: "dKn2dvfqjiiJ6DbJA") {
    status
  }
}
```

The `simulatedPrice` is now being affected by the pricing plugin, try it by changing the temperature threshold variable in `sausage.js`

## Step 4: Test Cart Checkout

Use the following GraphQL queries/mutations to do your first checkout.

You can browse to http://localhost:4010/graphql to bring up the GraphQL Playground.

To initiate a cart/basket, you need to be logged in. You can log in as a guest with a simple call:

```
mutation loginAsGuest {
  loginAsGuest {
    _id
    tokenExpires
  }
}
```

Then set the authorization header in GraphQL Playground for all upcoming operations:

```
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer HERE_GOES_THE_TOKEN_FROM_ABOVE"
}
```

Get the list of products:

```
query products {
  products {
    _id
    texts {
      title
    }
    ... on SimpleProduct {
      simulatedPrice(quantity: 2) {
        price {
          amount
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Add the product that you've found to the cart.

```
mutation addCartProduct {
  addCartProduct(productId: "A9e2kCJfcF9QZF4o9", quantity: 1) {
    _id
    order {
      items {
        _id
        quantity
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Tell Unchained more about the guy who orders:

```
mutation updateContact {
  updateCart(contact: { emailAddress: "hello@unchained.local" }, billingAddress: {firstName: "Pascal", addressLine: "Haha", postalCode: "5556", city: "somewhere"}) {
    _id
  }
}
```

Set order payment provider (optional):

```
mutation SetOrderPaymentProvider{
    setOrderPaymentProvider(
      orderId: "ORDERID",
      paymentProviderId: "PROVIDER_ID"
    )
  }
```

Set order delivery provider (optional):

```
mutation SetOrderDeliverProvider {
    setOrderDeliveryProvider(
      orderId: "ORDERID",
      deliveryProviderId: "PROVIDER_ID"
    )
  }
```

Checkout the cart:

```
mutation checkoutCart {
  checkoutCart {
    _id
    orderNumber
    ordered
    confirmed
  }
}
```

If everything went well, the e-mail debugs window will pop up presenting you with a simple order confirmation.

The exact configuration will differ from this template, as we encourage you to use a reverse proxy like traefik or Nginx for SSL termination and a replicated MongoDB with one daemon running in the same datacenter like an Unchained engine (low latency).
