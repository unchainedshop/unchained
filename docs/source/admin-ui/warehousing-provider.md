You can manage the warehousing providers in your shop by navigating to the "Warehousing Providers" page in the admin UI. This page is typically found under the "System Settings" section of the UI, and allows you to view and filter the existing warehousing providers that are configured for your shop.

The admin UI provides all the functionality you need to manage the configured warehousing plugins in your shop. This includes:
- **View and Filter**: You can view and filter the existing warehousing providers in your shop by various criteria, such as provider name or status.
- **Add New Warehousing Provider**: To add a new warehousing provider, simply click the "Add" button found on the warehousing provider list view. You'll be presented with a form where you can enter the provider type and adapter for your new provider. The adapter refers to the warehousing provider adapter plugin that is configured and loaded in your engine instance.
- **Update Existing Warehousing Provider**: You can update an existing warehousing provider by clicking the "Edit" icon next to that provider in the warehousing provider list view. This will open up a form where you can update the provider's configuration details.
- **Delete Warehousing Provider**: You can delete a warehousing provider from your shop by clicking the "Delete" button on either the provider list view or the provider detail page. However, be sure to check for any potential data integrity issues before deleting a provider, as the operation is not reversible.

It's important to note that in order to add or manage a warehousing provider in the admin UI, the provider must first be configured and loaded into your shop's unchained engine instance. Additionally, activating or deactivating warehousing providers is typically controlled by the plugin logic, rather than through the admin UI.
