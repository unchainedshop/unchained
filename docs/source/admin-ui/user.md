Admin UI provides a comprehensive interface for managing customer information on an e-commerce site, allowing you to view and/or manage user data based on your access rights. By default, every logged-in user can manage their own account, but to view and manage other users' data, a special role such as an admin or custom-configured role is required.

There are two types of users in Admin UI: guests and registered users. A guest user is created when the `loginAsGuest` API is used to log in. This is useful when you want to enable unregistered customers in your shop to still be able to add items to their cart and/or bookmark products without registering. However, when a user decides to checkout and order, they will need to register to complete the process.

If you have the appropriate privileges to view and/or manage other users' information, including guest users, you can do so by navigating to the "Users" page, where you can:
- View all users in the shop with filter and search capabilities
- Add a new user
- View detailed user information such as profile info, orders, quotations, subscriptions, and payment credentials
- Edit user profile information
- Delete a user
- View all orders made by a user
- View all quotations made by a user
- View all subscriptions made by a user
- View all payment credentials of a user

## View all Users
When you navigate to the Users page, you will be presented with an intuitive user interface that allows you to perform several actions such as:
- Filter and search through the list of users in the shop based on different criteria such as name, email, date of registration, etc. This makes it easier to find specific users quickly.

## Add new user
To add a new user to your shop, navigate to the Users page and click on the "Add" button located on the list view. You must have the necessary access rights to perform this action. The Add button will take you to a form where you can fill in the necessary details for the new user. Once the user has been added successfully, you will be redirected to the newly created user's detail page. On this page, you can view and edit additional information such as the user's profile picture, additional email addresses, and more.

##  View and/or edit user detail

- Profile Information: You can view the user's name, email address, phone number, and other details that were provided during registration.
