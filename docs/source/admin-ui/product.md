## Overview
Before we talk about all the product configuration capabilities available in unchained lets first have an overview of the different type of products supported in unchained.

Unchained Engine is a powerful e-commerce platform that enables merchants to create and manage their online stores with ease. It provides a range of features and functionalities that help merchants to sell their products online, such as inventory management, order processing, payment processing, and more. Here are the various types of products that Unchained Engine supports:

1. **SimpleProduct**: A simple product is a standard product with a fixed price and no variations or customization options. This type of product is suitable for merchants who sell standard, one-size-fits-all products that don't require any additional options or configurations. Examples of simple products include a single book or a basic t-shirt.

**Use case**: A clothing store might sell a basic t-shirt as a simple product. The product would have a fixed price and no variations or customization options. Customers would simply choose their size and color, add the item to their cart, and check out.

2. **TokenizedProduct**:A tokenized product is a digital product that is stored on a blockchain network and can be traded as a token. This type of product is useful for merchants who want to sell digital assets [NFT](https://ethereum.org/en/nft/) such as digital art or music in a secure and decentralized way.

**Use case**: An online marketplace for digital art might sell tokenized products that represent ownership of a specific piece of art. Customers would purchase the token and receive ownership of the artwork on the blockchain network. The artwork could then be traded or sold by the customer on the blockchain network.

3. **PlanProduct**: A plan product is a subscription-based product that customers pay for on a recurring basis.

Examples of plan products include a monthly subscription to a meal delivery service or a quarterly subscription to a magazine.

**Use case**: A meal delivery service might offer a plan product that provides customers with a certain number of meals each week. Customers would sign up for the plan and receive their meals on a recurring basis. The merchant would automatically bill the customer for the plan each month until they cancel.

4. **BundleProduct**: A bundle product is a collection of simple products that are sold as a package. This type of product is useful for merchants who want to sell related products together or provide customers with a discount for purchasing multiple products at once. Examples of bundle products include a set of kitchen utensils or a collection of books.

**Use case**: A bookstore might sell a bundle product that includes multiple books in a specific genre or by a specific author. The bundle would have a discounted price compared to buying each book separately. Customers would add the bundle to their cart and receive all the books in the bundle when they check out.

5. **ConfigurableProduct**: A configurable product is a product that has multiple options or configurations. This type of product is useful for merchants who sell products with variations or customization options, such as clothing with different sizes and colors or laptops with different specifications.

**Use case**: A clothing store might sell a configurable product that allows customers to choose the size, color, and style of a shirt. The price of the shirt would vary based on the selected options. Customers would choose their options, see the updated price, and add the item to their cart.
