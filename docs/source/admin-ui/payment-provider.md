To manage the payment providers supported in your e-commerce shop, you can navigate to the payment provider page in the system settings section of the admin UI. This page allows you to manage all the configured payment plugins in Unchained.

Using the payment provider page, you can perform the following actions:
- **View and filter payment providers**: The page displays all the payment providers that are currently configured in your e-commerce shop. You can also filter the payment providers by various criteria, such as provider name or status.
- **Add new payment provider**: You can add new payment providers to your e-commerce shop by selecting the provider you want to use and configuring the necessary settings.
- **Update existing payment provider**: You can update the settings for an existing payment provider, such as changing the payment method or updating the credentials required for the provider to function correctly.
- **Delete payment provider**: If a payment provider is no longer needed, you can delete it from your e-commerce shop.

By using the payment provider page in the admin UI, you can easily manage the payment providers supported in your e-commerce shop. This allows you to offer your customers a wide range of payment options and ensures that payments are processed smoothly and securely.

Please note that before you can add a new payment provider to your e-commerce shop using the admin UI, it must be configured and loaded into the Unchained engine instance that your shop is using. This means that you will need to have the necessary plugin files and configurations in place before you can start managing the payment provider through the admin UI.

Furthermore, it is important to understand that the activation and deactivation of payment providers is typically controlled by the plugin logic itself. This means that activating or deactivating a payment provider in the admin UI does not necessarily guarantee that it will be functional in your e-commerce shop. You will need to make sure that the plugin code and configurations are properly set up and maintained to ensure the smooth functioning of your payment providers.

## View and Filter payment providers
In the payment provider page of your e-commerce shop's admin UI, you can view and filter the payment providers that have been added to your shop based on their type. This can be useful when you have a large number of payment providers and want to quickly find providers of a particular type.

To view and filter payment providers by type, follow these steps:
- Navigate to the payment provider page in the admin UI.
- Look for the "Type" column in the list of payment providers. This column displays the type of each payment provider, such as "Credit Card", "PayPal", "Bank Transfer", etc.
- Click on the "Type" column header to sort the payment providers by type.
- Use the search bar or filter options available on the page to filter the payment providers by type. For example, you could filter the list to only display payment providers of the "Credit Card" type.

By viewing and filtering payment providers by type, you can easily find and manage the payment providers that are relevant to your e-commerce shop's needs. This can help you offer a wider range of payment options to your customers, improving their shopping experience and increasing the chances of successful transactions.

## Update payment providers
If you need to update the settings of a specific payment provider in your e-commerce shop, you can do so by clicking on the edit icon (usually represented by a pencil or similar icon) next to that payment provider in the payment provider list view. This will take you to the payment provider detail page, where you can edit various settings for the payment provider.

One of the main settings you can edit for a payment provider is the configuration. The configuration settings will depend on the specific payment provider you are working with, but may include things like API keys, merchant IDs, and other credentials needed to connect to the payment provider's services.

## Delete payment providers

- Payment Provider List View: You can delete a payment provider by clicking on the delete icon (usually represented by a trash can or similar icon) next to that payment provider in the payment provider list view.
- Payment Provider Detail Page: Alternatively, you can also delete a payment provider by opening the detail page for that provider and clicking on the "Delete" button.
