description: Add an order pricing plugin

Order price adapter gives you more control on how you charge based on an order. In order to add custom order pricing logic you first need to implement [IPricingAdapter](https://docs.unchained.shop/types/types/pricing.IPricingAdapter.html)  and register is to the global **OrderPricingDirector** which implements the [IPricingDirector](https://docs.unchained.shop/types/types/pricing.IPricingDirector.html).

There can be more than one order pricing plugin configurations and all of them will be executed based on there `orderIndex` value. Order pricing adapter with lower `orderIndex` will be executed first 

below is an example or IPricingAdapter implementation that will add $50 to each order as service charge


```typescript
import {
  OrderPricingSheet,
  IOrderPricingSheet,
  OrderPricingAdapterContext,
} from '@unchainedshop/types/order.js';

import { LogOptions } from '@unchainedshop/types/logs.js';
import { OrderPricingCalculation } from '@unchainedshop/types/orders.pricing.js';
import { IPricingAdapter, IPricingAdapterActions } from '@unchainedshop/types/pricing.js';
import { Discount } from '@unchainedshop/types/discount.js';

export const ShopOrderPricingAdapter: IOrderPricingAdapter = {
  key: 'shop-order-service-pricing',
  label: 'Default service charge price',
  version: '1.0.0',
  orderIndex: 1,

  isActivatedFor: (context: OrderPricingAdapterContext) => {
    return true;
  },

  log(message: string, options?: LogOptions): void {
    console.log(message);
  },

  actions: (params: {
    calculationSheet: IOrderPricingSheet;
    context: OrderPricingAdapterContext;
    discounts: Discount[];
  }): IPricingAdapterActions<OrderPricingCalculation, OrderPricingAdapterContext> & {
    resultSheet: () => IOrderPricingSheet;
  } => {
    const calculation: OrderPricingCalculation[] = [];
    const { context } = params;
    const { currency } = context;
    const resultSheet = OrderPricingSheet({ currency });

    return {
      calculate: async (): Promise<OrderPricingCalculation[]> => {
        const resultRaw = resultSheet.getRawPricingSheet();
        resultSheet.addPayment({ amount: 100, taxAmount: 0 });
        resultRaw.forEach(
          ({ amount, category }) =>
            ShopOrderPricingAdapter.log(`Order Pricing Calculation -> ${category} ${amount}`),
          resultRaw,
        );
        return resultRaw;
      },
      getContext: (): OrderPricingAdapterContext => params.context,
      resultSheet: () => resultSheet,
      getCalculation: (): OrderPricingCalculation[] => calculation,
    };
  },
};

```

- **isActiveFor(context: [OrderPricingAdapterContext](https://docs.unchained.shop/types/interfaces/orders_pricing.OrderPricingAdapterContext.html))**: Used to activate or de-active a particular order price plugin based on the current context of the order or any other business rule.
- **calculate**: is where the actual calculation of the order price is done based on the calculation items defined for the adapter.
- **getContext**: returns the current order payment price plugin context.
- **resultSheet**: return the price sheet items that are  applied on the price adapter.


```typescript
import {OrderPriceDirector} from '@unchainedshop/core-orders'

OrderPriceDirector.registerAdapter(ShopOrderPricingAdapter)
```
