# List of tasks to improve open source solution 

## 1. Smooth onboarding flow (no interruptions)
- Email verification ends in error page
- Error on startup in task (booting) -> Admin UI does not start-up (stuck in App not ready screen)

## 2. Improve instance overview in Unchained Cloud
- Add instance status (error, running, booting) on top
- Link to storefront setup docs (when launching a new eninge)
- (Add option to add a link/quick open option to the instance for the storefront) <- E2E view

## 3. !!!Create active technical communication feed to build a Unchained community (Studentenjob / Studiumsabgänger)!!!
- Post every week something little (technical) about the Unchained Engine
  - Defined communication plan & dedicated time slot (for dev as well)
- Do we have a FAQ? --> Github discussion
- Do we have a Video to post?
- Post link to Unchained solution everywhere ...
- Sream a live developement session every month 🤓
- Organisation von Hackatons, Developer Meetups
- Idea Pascal: Building a Crypto-Commerce education community / platform

## 4. User Testing for Documentation and Setup
- Let's test it with real users (documentation & setup)
- To do it coordinated we need a bit of planning and organisation (best would be to invite people to our office)
- Having a iteration cicle to improve the product and retest over several month (continous improvement)

## 5. Explain plugin model and engine options
- A documentaion of the full feature set (e.g. plugins) needs to be accessible and understandable as fast as possible (main driver to decide whether to use the eninge or not)
- Main focus on explaining how to setup and upgrade the Payment providers and add product plugins to load data. This is not yet explained step by step in the docs (to be tested with users).

## 6. (Remove header banner once the user is in the signup or login flow or already logged in the Control Panel is shown.)
