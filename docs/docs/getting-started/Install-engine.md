Usage and Configuration Options for the Cryptopay Plugin

In this section, we will walk you through the steps required to start up an Unchained Engine API server locally.

This tutorial helps you:

- Configure and run unchained engine.
- Access the engine through the [Admin UI sandbox](https://sandbox-v3.unchained.shop/log-in)
- Open the graphQL playground of your local Unchained Engine

.

## Step 1: Installation

1. First create a new folder for your project to be installed.

```bash
mkdir my-unchained-engine
cd my-unchained-engine
```

2. Use the Unchained initialization script to download the code.

```bash
npm init @unchainedshop
```

3. A message prompts you to select the installation template. Choose **Unchained engine** by using the `down key` and press `enter`

```bash
? What type of template do you want ›
Full stack e-commerce
Storefront
Unchained engine <--
```

4. Next two steps are to select the directory, as we already created a new empty directory you can simply press `enter`, and whether you want to initialize git which is up to you.

```bash
? Directory name relative to current directory
 (press Enter to use current directory) ›
? Do you want Initialize git? no / yes
```

5. Make sure your node version is 22+ and install the npm packages

```bash
npm install
```

The installation script downloads, installs and initialises all files and packages required to build and run unchained engine.

## Step 2: Start the Unchained Engine

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [localhost:4010](http://localhost:4010) to check if your unchained engine is running correctly. You should see the following **Landing page** in your browser

## Open Admin UI sandbox
On the initial landing page there are various options you can choose including [Use sandbox Admin UI](https://sandbox-v3.unchained.shop/log-in). Click on that button to mange you local engine instance using the admin ui sandbox, it will redirect you to a login page, use the below credentials to login into the engine and make sure to change the credentials as soon as possible

**Username**: _admin@unchained.local_<br />
**Password**: _password_

You can also click on [Graphql playground](http://localhost:4010/graphql) to opens the GraphQL playground for you to easily execute queries and mutations.

## Step 3: Add Products

If you want to set up the store and add products and categories using the admin UI follow the instruction of the [Getting-Started](/getting-started/add-products) guide using your local instance under [localhost:4010](http://localhost:4010).

Follow the examples to learn about how to add products, initiate a check-out and use plugins with GraphQL.

## Run the Storefront template

An easy way to test the Unchained Engine is to setup the test storefront web app created with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) locally and connect our local Unchained Engine GraphQL API to it which is covered in the next chapter.
