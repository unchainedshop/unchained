This chapter teaches you how to add new products and categories to your store. It explains the major entities like categories, pricing & products required to show some products in the storefront app.

Steps:

- Log into your Admin UI
- Fill your store with content using the Admin UI
- Understand the store's data entities
- Use GraphQL queries and mutations to feed and search over the Unchained Engine api.

<p class="info">This is an example application of a management admin UI.<br />The Unchained Engine is designed for professional enterprise applications and uses powerful plugins to connect to existing CRM solutions which should be the choice if you build the store.<br />However, to start we can manage a simple shop catalogue and add a basic payment option using the provide Admin UI.</p>

## Step 1: Access Admin UI

In order to add content to your store, you need to log into the store's admin UI [sandbox](https://sandbox-v3.unchained.shop/). By default the sandbox is pointed to your `localhost:4010` port but in case you change the local engine endpoint to something else you can simply change the **ENDPOINT** URL

Navigate to the login window of your admin UI

Initially the username and password are set as following:

**Username**: _admin@unchained.local_<br />
**Password**: _password_

<p class="warning">This is a test project using common hard-coded credentials. Change your password as soon as you intend to work professionally with the engine. (<b class="normal"><code class="language-text">Account</code> ‚û§ <code class="language-text">Change password</code></b>)</p>

## Step 1: Add Payment Provider

One of the basic settings besides the **currency** & **language** is the **payment provider** for your store. We gonna add a simple _Pay per invoice_ method to our shop.<br />
Check [Further Reading](#further-reading) at the end of this chapter for a (growing) list of payment plugins available for the Unchained Engine.

- On side navigation choose the menu entry **`System setting` ‚û§ `Payment providers`**
  ![diagramm](../assets/add-payment-step-1.png)
- Click on **`Add`** in the empty list view.
- Select type **`Invoice`**, choose the adapter **`Invoice (manually)`** and click on **`Add new adapter`** to save invoice payment provider.
  ![diagramm](../assets/add-payment-step-2.png)
- Click **`Save`** in the next screen as we do not need to add any additional configuration keys in this example project.
- The new payment provider **INVOICE** page will open.

## Step 2: Set Delivery Option

The second important configuration is **delivery option** which defines where and how orders should be send to for furhter processing.<br />

- On top choose the menu entry **`System settings` ‚û§ `Delivery providers`**
- Click on **`Add`** in the empty list view.
- Select type **`Shipping`**, choose the adapter **`Forward Delivery via Messaging`** and click on **`Add Delivery provider`** to continue.
  ![diagramm](../assets/add-delivery-step-1.png)
- In the configuration window set email addresses (can be non-existing phantom addresses) for the keys **from** and **to**, delete the **cc** key and click **`Save`**.
- The new delivery provider **SHIPPING** should appear in the list. (You might need to select the delivery list again in the top menu)

## Step 3: Add Product

It's time to add our first product to the store.

- On side navigation menu entry **`Products`**
- Click on **`Add`** in the empty product list.
- Give the product a **name** and set the **type** to `Simple Product`.
  ![diagramm](../assets/new-product-form.png)
- Click **`Add product`** to save the product and navigate to the product detail view.
- (If you have one ready, add a nice product image under `Media`.)
- Select **`Commerce`** on the left and set the price for your product.
- Per default a product is in the state **draft**. To make it available in the shop we need to **`publish`** it.<br />On the right you find the option to publish (and unpublish) to product.
  ![diagramm](../assets/product-detail-2.png)
- Great! The product is ready to be assigned to a category.
- Do it again and add a second product!

## Step 4: Create Category (Assortment) with Products

Firstly, we will add two new categories which are called _Assortments_ in the Admin UI.

- On side navigation menu entry **`Assortments`**.
- Click on **`Add`**.
![diagramm](../assets/new-assortment-form.png)
- Give your category a **title**, keep the _root node_ option checked.
- Click **`Add Assortment`** to save the category and navigate to the category detail view.
- (Same here, add a nice category image under `Media`.)
  ![diagram](../assets/assortment-detail-page.png)
- Select **`Products`** tab.
- Search for the **(exact)** name of the product you added in [Step 3](#step-3-add-product), select it
  and click **`Add Product`** to link the product to the category

## Step 5. Admire the Products

Open your local storefront app http://localhost:3000 and verify that the categories appear on the entry page.
Choose a category to see the underlying products and start shopping! üòé

##¬†Step 6: Place an Order
Now, you are able to go through a complete check-out and buy a product with the pay-per-invoice payment method.

On successful completion of an order you will find a new entry in the **Orders** list and a detailed order view including the the **Invoice Paid** option.
