## Make base
Base assortments are top-level assortments that cannot be assigned as child assortments of another assortment. If an assortment was not initially added as a base assortment, you can make it base by navigating to the assortment detail page. From there, you can select the "Make Base" option, which will promote the assortment to a base assortment. This is useful when you need to restructure your assortments or if you have new assortments that need to be classified as base. Keep in mind that once an assortment has been made base, it cannot be assigned as a child of another assortment. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider your assortment structure and hierarchy before making any changes.

## Edit assortment tags
You can easily manage the tags assigned to an assortment using the tag section found at the top of the assortment detail page. From there, you can add or delete tags as needed to ensure that your assortment is properly classified and easy to find. This feature is useful when you need to quickly update the tags associated with an assortment or when you want to make sure that your assortments are properly organized and categorized. Simply click on the tag section to access the tag management options, and you can easily add or delete tags as needed.

## Manage assortment Medias
To manage media files associated with an assortment, navigate to the "Media" tab on the assortment detail page. From there, you can upload, edit, and delete media files as needed. An assortment can have multiple media files assigned to it, which can include images, videos, or other types of media.

This feature is useful when you need to showcase your assortment and provide customers with visual information about your products.

## Manage assortment Filters
To manage filters associated with an assortment, navigate to the "Filter" tab on the assortment detail page. From there, you can add or remove links to filters that are relevant to your assortment. This feature is useful when you want to make it easier for customers to find products within a specific category or with certain attributes. Simply click on the "Filter" tab to access the filter management options, and you can easily add or remove links to filters as needed. Keep in mind that filters need to be created before they can be linked to an assortment.

## Manage assortment Links
To manage links to other assortments associated with an assortment, navigate to the "Links" tab on the assortment detail page. From there, you can add or remove links to other assortments as needed. This feature is useful when you want to create a hierarchy of related products or categories, and make it easy for customers to navigate through your assortment.

Keep in mind that a non-root assortment can be assigned as a child to multiple assortments, as long as it is not a base assortment type. However, you should avoid creating cyclic relationships, where two or more assortments are part of the same link parent hierarchy. This type of relationship is not currently supported by Unchained, and can lead to unexpected issues.

Note that base assortments can only have children, but cannot be assigned as a child to another assortment. This is because base assortments are top-level categories that cannot be part of a hierarchy themselves.

In summary, the "Links" tab allows you to create and manage relationships between different assortments, which can help you create a more organized and intuitive shopping experience for your customers.

## Manage assortment Products
To add products to an assortment, navigate to the "Products" tab on the assortment detail page. From there, you can assign multiple products to the assortment, which can help customers easily find the products they're interested in.

It's important to note that a product can belong to multiple categories, so there is no restriction on assigning a product to multiple assortments. This can help you create a more flexible and intuitive product catalog, where customers can find products based on their needs and interests, rather than being limited by a strict category structure.

By assigning products to assortments, you can also help customers discover related or complementary products, which can increase sales and customer satisfaction. Keep in mind that products need to be created before they can be assigned to an assortment. If you haven't created any products yet, you can do so by following the instructions provided in the [Products](./products) documentation.
