## What You'll Build

By the end of this guide, you'll have a fully working web shop with your first product and first test order.

## Guide Structure

This Quick Start guide is organized into the following sections:

1. **[Development Environment Setup](./setup-environment)** - Install required tools and prepare your system

## Architecture Overview

Unchained Engine follows a headless architecture with three main components:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│   Storefront    │────▶│ Unchained Engine│◀────│    Admin UI     │
│   (Next.js)     │     │   (GraphQL API) │     │      (SPA)      │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
                                │
                                ▼
                        ┌─────────────────┐
                        │     MongoDB     │
                        └─────────────────┘
```
