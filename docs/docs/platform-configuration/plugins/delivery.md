## Development Notes

### Custom Delivery Plugins

Create custom delivery plugins by implementing the `IDeliveryAdapter` interface:

```javascript
import { IDeliveryAdapter, DeliveryAdapter, DeliveryDirector } from '@unchainedshop/core';

const CustomDelivery = {
  ...DeliveryAdapter,
  
  key: 'shop.custom.delivery',
  label: 'Custom Delivery Method',
  version: '1.0.0',
  
  typeSupported: (type) => {
    return type === 'SHIPPING'; // or 'PICKUP'
  },
  
  actions: (config, context) => {
    return {
      ...DeliveryAdapter.actions(config, context),
      
      isActive: () => true,
      configurationError: () => null,
      
      // Additional methods for pickup providers
      pickUpLocations: async () => [...],
      pickUpLocationById: async (id) => {...}
    };
  }
};

DeliveryDirector.registerAdapter(CustomDelivery);
```
