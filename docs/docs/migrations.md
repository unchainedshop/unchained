Covers: v2 → v3 and v3 → v4

## General Upgrade Process

1. **Read the migration guide** for your target version
2. **Update dependencies** in `package.json`
3. **Start the platform** - database migrations run automatically on startup
4. **Update code** for any breaking API changes
5. **Test thoroughly** before deploying to production
